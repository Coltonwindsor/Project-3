Project - 3

Link to app:
Journal Hub!
A place to create and store your thoughts and habbits!

Problem Statement:
Some people love to eat. Some people love to sleep. Some people love to exercise, and some people love to daydream. Some people love to do all of those things and then write about them. Those that habitually journal about many different things have a problem - they lack an easy way to store and sort all of their material.

Target users and purpose:
Journal Hub provides a platform for avid journalers to store all their journals in one place, as well as create, edit and delete entries.
